      <p>Ideally the people I want to target are those in the market for web developers that understand how their website works along with how to improve it.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>YooBoot Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Yooboot wouldn't be a video streaming site without both videos from your subsribed accounts, and from other accounts out there creating new content. What makes the Home feed so special is the focus on discovering something new, whether it's a classic minecraft lets play, or a 3 hour documentary on government conspiracies. These peculiar topics spark new passions and interests that lead to further growth and hopefully intelligence.

      <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
      <p>
        With Subscriptions you can stay up to date with your favorite creators to see what they're up to. A big plus to the subscriptions tab is the ability to focus in on the content you subscribed to without all the extra fluff. Keep it simple, straight forward, and fun.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page will feature a selection of recommended videos tailored specifically for you, ensuring that you have easy access to content that matches your interests. Additionally, it will include a sidebar that provides various options for you to explore. This sidebar will allow you to navigate to different sections, such as your subscriptions, where you can stay updated with content from your favorite creators. It will also include quick access to your personal account, making it convenient to manage your settings, preferences, and uploaded content. The home page is designed to enhance your viewing experience by offering both personalized recommendations and seamless navigation.
      </p>
      <img src="images/home-yooboot.jpg" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
      <p>         
        Subscriptions will exclusively display content from users you have chosen to follow. This ensures that you have a dedicated space to keep up with the latest videos from your favorite creators without distractions from unrelated content. By focusing solely on followed users, the subscriptions section helps you stay connected with the content that matters most to you, providing an organized and streamlined viewing experience.
      </p>
      <img src="images/subscriber-yooboot.jpg" alt="subscriptions wireframe">

      <h3>You</h3>
      <p>         
        The You page will provide comprehensive information about your account on the platform. It will display details such as the videos you have posted, allowing you to keep track of your content. Additionally, it will showcase your bio, giving others insight into who you are, as well as your avatar, which serves as a visual representation of your profile. This page is designed to help you manage and personalize your presence on the platform, ensuring that your account details are easily accessible and well-organized.
